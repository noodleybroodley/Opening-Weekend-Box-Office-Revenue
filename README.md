# Opening Weekend at the Box Office:
### An Exploratory Data Analysis of Box Office Revenue
<br></br>

# Background & Motivation
At the fundamental level, films are investments for production companies. Every decision these companies make when preparing for a release is a strategic effort to maximize profits, including when they decide to release movies. In my data analysis, I sought to find out which months have the highest opening weekend revenue.

# Questions
<ul>
	<li>Which months usually have the highest opening weekend revenue?</li>
	<li>In which months are movies released more frequently?</li>
	<li>Are the trends the same for each year represented?</li>
	<li>Are the trends the same for the four most represented distributors in the dataset?</li>
</ul>

# Data
I collected my data from Box Office Mojo, which is a database managed by IMDB that contains box office information for different movies. I specifically used their table containing the Top 1000 Opening Weekend Box Office Revenues. Scraping the data using a <a href="src/create_csv.py">Python script</a> resulted in the data below.
